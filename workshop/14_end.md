> [!NOTE]
> Check out the final code by running:
>
> ```sh
> git merge origin/spoilers
> ```

> [!TIP]
> If the public instance is still up when you read this, you can connect to it at **104.248.254.123** and chat with others!

> Simply run:

> ```sh
> cargo run -p tui -- --ip 104.248.254.123
> ```

Here are some ideas to extend the application:

- Add a [`Scrollbar`](https://docs.rs/ratatui/latest/ratatui/widgets/struct.Scrollbar.html) to the message list
- Support different themes
- Improve the look & feel by using different border styles, colors, etc.
